# Bloxstrap Gold

**Bloxstrap Gold** is an enhanced extension to Bloxstrap that offers advanced tools, optimizations, and control for power users. It builds on Bloxstrap’s foundation and unlocks capabilities beyond the default experience.

It’s ideal for anyone who wants to push Roblox further than what the base client allows — all while keeping things stable and usable.

---

## Features

- **Multi-instance launching**  
  Seamlessly run multiple local Roblox clients with account isolation — no hacks or patches needed.

- **Fast Flag customization**  
  Access all internal Roblox Fast Flags to enable experimental features and tweak engine behavior. Whitelisted Flags not enough? Gold is for you.

- **Performance boosts**  
  Lower latency, increase frame rates, and remove unnecessary overhead to make your client run smoother.

- **Privacy & security enhancements**  
  Reduce telemetry, lock down sessions, and limit unwanted data exposure.

- **Rich presence & game info**  
  Show what game you're in, region, server IP, and more — let your friends see what you’re up to.

## Installing

1. Download the latest release (Gold version) from the **Releases** page.  
2. Run the installer.  
3. Configure your preferences.  
4. Launch Roblox via Bloxstrap Gold to enjoy the additional features.

Make sure you have the required runtime (e.g. .NET 6 Desktop Runtime) installed; the installer may prompt you if it is missing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is Bloxstrap Gold safe / malware?**  
A: Yes. As long as you download it from [bloxstraplabs.com](https://bloxstraplabs.com) or this GitHub page, it's safe. The builds are signed and verified. Any other versions are not trusted.

**Q: Can I request a feature or report a bug?**  
A: Yes! Open an issue on this repository with clear details. Feedback helps shape future updates.
